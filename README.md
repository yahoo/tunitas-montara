# Montara Mountain, a Reference Implementation of IAB's PrivacyChain

## Overview

The PrivacyChain specification is documented in the [IAB PrivacyChain Specification](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/PrivacyChain). There is a reference implementation therein which is based on Java.  This is the C++2a implementation which uses _Modules TS_.

This reference implementation also clarifies the unspecified behaviors necessary to make a practical implementation.  This document also provides guidance towards the future evolution of the API in the _Compatibility_ subsections.
